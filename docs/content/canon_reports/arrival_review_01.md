# Canon Review Report: Track 001 Arrival Packs

## Executive Summary
| Pack ID | Role | Result | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `arrival_v1` | Planner | **PASS** | Perfect atmospheric alignment with Seagrove Bay landing. |
| `arrival_v2` | Planner | **PASS** | Establishes the 'Systems' layer early; consistent with Julian's voice. |
| `arrival_v3` | Planner | **REJECT** | **Tone Breach:** Too high-energy. Exclamation marks and "Let's go" energy break the Foundation Rule: "Never noisy... restricted energy". |
| `journal_v1` | Planner | **PASS** | Eleanor's voice is spot-on. Poetic and welcoming. |
| `journal_v2` | Planner | **PASS** | Validates the 'Systems' perspective on the Hearth. Interesting lore tension. |
| `journal_v3` | Planner | **PASS** | Cassie's curiosity is well-contained and adds character depth. |

## Required Edits for `arrival_v3`
- Remove exclamation marks.
- Lower the urgency.
- Shift "Don't just stand there" to something more inquisitive (e.g., "The silence here feels like a question.").

## Lore Verification
- All packs correctly reference the `leather_journal` and `seagrove_bay` canon nodes.
- No forbidden vibes (aggression/horror) detected.
